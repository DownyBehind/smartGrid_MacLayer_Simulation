### Step 1. Analysis of Differences Between Current Experimental Environment and Thesis Environment

| Item | Thesis Environment (Figure 1) | Current Experimental Environment | Differences & Considerations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medium Environment** | Wired (Powerline communication-based HomePlug Green PHY) | Wireless (802.11g based), approximating the wireless environment with FreeSpacePathLoss | The current method of modeling a wired PLC environment as wireless has differences in channel characteristics, interference, and delay. |
| **Network Configuration** | Single receiver + multiple transmitters (Star network) | 1 central receiving node + multiple transmitting nodes (Centralized structure is similar) | The similarity in network structure is sufficiently met. |
| **MAC Protocol** | HPGP MAC (CSMA/CA based, similar to EDCA but uses a clearly defined BEB and priority channel access) | Using IEEE 802.11 EDCA mode (`mac.useEdca=true`) | The essence of the MAC protocol is similar, but parameter tuning is needed (e.g., CW value, AIFSN). |
| **CW Parameter** | CW fixed at 7 (non-exponential BEB), making the contention window adaptively change. | CW values are set differently for each AC of EDCA, but adaptive dynamic adjustment is not implemented. | Needs to be matched with the thesis environment by setting a fixed CW=7. |
| **Retry Count Limit** | Retry limit exists (packet dropped after 7 failures). | Currently, retry limit is not explicitly set (using default value). | Explicit setting of the retry limit is needed (e.g., setting `retryLimit`). |
| **Traffic Characteristics** | Traffic sent at a constant interval (regular interval, inferred as 0.5ms~5ms from the thesis). | Currently set with constant traffic at a 0.5ms interval. | The traffic transmission interval is similar. |
| **Packet Size** | Not specified in the thesis, but in a PLC environment, messages are generally short (tens to hundreds of bytes). | Currently using a rather large packet size of 1500 bytes. | Needs to be changed to a smaller packet (though it can be maintained as is for initial experiments). |
| **ACK Usage** | Not explicitly specified in the thesis, but ACK usage is generally assumed. | By default, IEEE 802.11 EDCA uses ACK. | Similar. |
